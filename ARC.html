        <h1>ARC: The Recovery Statements</h1>
        <p>I was commissioned by mental health charity ARC, based in the South West of England, to create ten illustrations depicting the recovery statements that enable them to classify a personâ€™s general wellbeing and satisfaction in life . The ten statements encourage the potential client to think about different areas of their life, that are considered to be some of
          the key pillars to counter anxiety and depression. My task was
          to present this visually for their website and brochures, in a sensitive and symbolic way. The final product was linoprinted and letterpressed to create fine art prints. The final prints were then scanned digitally to be used online.
          You can read all ten of the recovery measures and check out the full illustrated series on the ARC website.</p>
